# **App Name**: Gemini Muse

## Core Features:

- Concept Input: Users input a basic idea or subject for their desired image.
- Artistic Style Selection: A curated list of artistic styles, such as photorealistic, abstract, anime, etc., to choose from, including but not limited to Moody Portrait, Cinematic City Night, Vintage Landscape / Nostalgic Scene, Sci-Fi / Futuristic Vibe. This helps tailor the generated prompt.
- Prompt Generation: Generates optimized prompts for the Gemini image model, combining the user's input with selected artistic styles and other creative elements. Uses a tool for the prompt generation logic to combine input and pre-programmed 'style' information, to make variations.
- Prompt Variations: Displays multiple prompt variations to give users different options and perspectives for their image creation. Example prompts are based on initial input but will have stylistic variations to encourage iterative image creation.
- Clipboard Integration: Enables users to easily copy the generated prompts to their clipboard for use in the Gemini AI or other image generation platforms.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to establish a sophisticated, creative atmosphere. The purple is suggestive of imagination and possibility.
- Background color: Dark navy (#1A237E) for a sleek and modern feel, allowing the neon accents to pop. The darkness also makes the UI elements visually separate from generated AI content.
- Accent color: Vibrant neon blue (#29B6F6) for interactive elements and highlights, providing a visually striking contrast.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clean, minimalist icons with a neon aesthetic to maintain a modern look.
- Maintain a clean and structured layout that prioritizes ease of use. Focus on clear information hierarchy and intuitive navigation to streamline user experience.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and loading animations to enhance the user experience. Use motion to guide users through the prompt generation process without causing distraction.
